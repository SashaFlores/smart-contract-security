<h3>Repository Highlights üìö</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn how to effectively report findings, including how to structure your report and communicate the impact of the issue. This repository also provides guidance on submitting appeals to defend your code or findings, as appeals are sometimes necessary to clarify severity or validity.</li>
    <li>Findings are presented here as they were initially reported to encourage developers to start documenting their work, even if it‚Äôs not perfect. Starting messy is better than not starting at all, and this repository demonstrates how reporting improves with experience.</li>
    <li>With each iteration, this repository will continue to refine and enhance examples of how to write and present findings, helping developers improve their skills over time.</li>
    <li>This repository hosts an open <a href="https://github.com/SashaFlores/smart-contract-security/discussions">Discussions</a> section for Q&A, ideas, announcements, and general conversations. Feel free to start a conversation, suggest improvements, or provide feedback.</li>
    <li>This repository also features an open <a href="https://github.com/SashaFlores/smart-contract-security/issues">Issues</a> section for bug reports, feature requests, and general improvements. Feel free to report a bug, suggest a feature, or contribute to ongoing discussions.</li>
