<summary>free tokens without paying a dime!!</summary>
In `sendEthEarnToken` function below, tokens are minted directly to `msg.sender` while `ETH` is sent to `to` address. To exploit the function, a user can easily set `to` address the same as `msg.sender` that way the user will get free tokens and the same `ETH` he initially sent to the contract back.
