Gas Griefing: A General Description
Gas griefing is a type of attack in Ethereum smart contracts where an attacker deliberately causes transactions to consume an excessive amount of gas. This can lead to transactions failing due to running out of gas or becoming prohibitively expensive to execute. Gas griefing can disrupt the normal operation of a contract and cause financial losses or delays.

Example Scenario
Consider a scenario where a smart contract allows users to perform a batch of operations. An attacker can exploit this by including operations that consume a large amount of gas, causing the entire batch to fail or become very expensive.

Example Code
Here is an example of a vulnerable contract that allows users to perform a batch of token transfers:
