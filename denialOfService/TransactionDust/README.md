# Transaction Dust Attack: Withdraw Function Threshold


A <strg>Transaction Dust Attack</strg> can exploit smart contracts by creating numerous small or zero-value transactions that clog the contract’s transaction processing system. This attack is particularly effective in contracts that maintain a backlog of transactions, such as withdrawal requests. By spamming zero-value withdrawals, an attacker can drastically increase the gas cost needed to process legitimate transactions, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.

 ### *How It Works*

#### *1- Zero-Value Spam Withdrawals:*

An attacker repeatedly calls the `withdraw` function with zero-value amounts, spamming the `withdrawals` list with entries that require processing but hold no value.


#### *2- Increased Gas Costs for Legitimate Users:*

When a legitimate user or governance tries to process a real withdrawal, they must first clear the backlog of zero-value withdrawals. This significantly increases the gas required for processing, making it prohibitively expensive for governance to fulfill legitimate requests.


#### *3- Effective Fund Locking:* 

If the gas required to process all zero-value entries exceeds what governance can afford, funds will be effectively locked in the contract. This results in a DoS, as legitimate users cannot access their funds due to the high transaction costs.





### Severity Level : 

Medium

### Impact: 

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

- Inaccessible Funds:

Legitimate users are prevented from withdrawing their funds due to excessive zero-value entries.

- High Gas Costs: 

Processing legitimate withdrawals becomes too expensive as the number of zero-value entries grows, creating a financial burden on governance or users who need to process these transactions.


- Operational Inefficiency: 

The contract’s functionality becomes impractical until the backlog is cleared, leading to a DoS scenario for legitimate users.


### Recommended Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of a Transaction Dust Attack, we can implement a threshold requirement that ensures only meaningful withdrawal amounts are processed. This simple check prevents zero-value and dust-level transactions from cluttering the withdrawals list.

#### *1- Enforce a Minimum Withdrawal Threshold:*

Introduce a require statement that sets a minimum threshold for withdrawals, preventing zero-value entries from being added to the backlog.

```
function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    require(amount > 10e6, "Amount must be greater than 0"); // Minimum withdrawal threshold
    burn(amount);
    withdrawals.push(Withdrawal(msg.sender, amount));
}
```


#### *2- Periodic Cleanup of Zero-Value Entries (Optional):*

If any zero-value entries are already present in the contract, consider implementing an administrative function to periodically clear them, restoring efficiency to the `withdrawals` list.

#### *3- Off-Chain Monitoring and Alerts:*

Set up an off-chain monitoring system to detect abnormal withdrawal patterns and alert governance to potential spamming activity. This can help in identifying attacks early and preventing further entries if they arise.
